# UKBB tabular data retrieving with R
This repo is for filtering the data you need from the tabular format UK Biobank data. To run this, you need to have a `*.arrow` file with the data. To get this, look at [this repo](https://github.com/CoBrALab/UKBB-tabular-processing). You'll also need the `Codings.tsv` and `Data_Dictionary_Showcase.tsv` from [UKBB Showcase Accessing Data](https://biobank.ndph.ox.ac.uk/showcase/exinfo.cgi?src=AccessingData).  

This repo contains two files. The `functions.R` contains the two function you'll need to filter and clean the data, while `examples.R` just presents some examples of how to use these functions.
